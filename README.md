# Research Paper Knowledge Graph and Recommender System

## Project Description

Knowledge graphs have emerged as powerful tools for representing and organizing information in a structured and interconnected manner. In this project, we aim to build a knowledge graph and a recommender system for research papers. 

This project is divided into three parts:

1. **Charting the Research Landscape**: Building a knowledge graph that represents the interconnectedness of a wide pool of research papers.
2. **The Search for Knowledge**: Designing a recommender system that suggests similar and important research papers.
3. **Unveiling the Trailblazers**: Conducting an impact analysis to identify the research works that have made the most significant impact on other papers .

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python: Python is likely the primary language for this project, given its wide range of libraries that support data analysis and machine learning. Should understand to use different tools and libraries like:-
    - json
    - rdflib
    - holoviews
    - networkx
    - pickle
    - transformers
    - torch
    - sklearn
    - scipy
    - numpy
    - pandas
    - matplotlib
    - seaborn
    - datetime
    - collections
    - nltk
    - re
 - OpenAI API key: if exploration of GraphGPT is required.
 - Dataset: Access to the dataset (https://bit.ly/balkanid-ds-dataset-download) is necessary. Knowledge of how to handle JSONL files may also be necessary as indicated by the mention of new_research_papers.jsonl (https://bit.ly/balkanid-new-data-download).
 - Understanding of Recommender Systems: You should be familiar with the concept of recommender systems, information retrieval, and have a basic understanding of algorithms used in these systems such as pagerank, HITS or others.
 - Knowledge of Knowledge Graphs: A basic understanding of Knowledge Graphs, RDF Framework, and SPARQL language.

### Installation

Run:- <br/>
```pip install -r requirements.txt``` <br/>
on the terminal to install all of the Python modules and packages listed in your requirements.txt file.

## How to Use

1) Download dataset.jsonl and new_research_papers.jsonl files in the same directory
2) Run the Task1.ipynb file first to construct the knowledge graph and view results.
3) Run EDA.ipynb and view results.
4) Run Task2.ipynb and view results.
5) Run Task3.ipynb and view results.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Before building our knowledge graph and recommender system, we performed an exploratory data analysis to understand the structure and characteristics of our dataset. 

### EDA Approach

[Provide a clear explanation of your approach to EDA. Describe any patterns, anomalies, or relationships you discovered that helped inform your approach to the project.]

### EDA Findings

[Describe the main findings from your EDA. Provide visualizations to support these findings if available.]

1. ![EDA Example 1](./path/to/eda-example1.png)
2. ![EDA Example 2](./path/to/eda-example2.png)
3. ![EDA Example 3](./path/to/eda-example3.png)

[For each visualization, provide a brief explanation.]

## Part 1: Charting the Research Landscape
